🌐 Exploring Data with Machine Learning - A Django Project

Excited to share my latest project - a data analysis website built using Django! 🚀

I've always been passionate about leveraging the power of machine learning for data exploration and analysis. With this project, I aimed to create a user-friendly platform that allows anyone to delve into their datasets and gain insights effortlessly.

🔍 Key Features:

Interactive Data Visualization: Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly, users can visualize their data in various formats such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. Interactive features enable users to zoom, pan, and explore their data dynamically.

Machine Learning Models: Integrated popular machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn library to provide predictive analysis. Users can train models for regression, classification, or clustering tasks directly on their datasets, making informed decisions backed by data-driven insights.

Data Preprocessing Tools: Implemented functionalities for data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. These tools streamline the data preparation process, ensuring cleaner and more accurate analyses.

User Authentication and Permissions: Implemented user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system. Users can register, log in securely, and manage their datasets. Admin privileges restrict access to sensitive functionalities, maintaining data privacy and security.

Responsive Design: Developed a responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework. The website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Backend: Django, Python
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, scikit-learn
Database: SQLite (for development)
